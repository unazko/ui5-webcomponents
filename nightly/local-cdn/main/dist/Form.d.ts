/**
 * @class
 *
 * ### Overview
 *
 * The Form is a layout component that arranges labels and form fields (like input fields) pairs
 * into a specific number of columns.
 *
 * ### Structure
 *
 * - **Form** (`ui5-form`) is the top-level container component, responsible for the content layout and responsiveness.
 * - **FormGroup** (`ui5-form-group`) enables the grouping of the Form content.
 * - **FormItem** (`ui5-form-item`) is a pair of label and form fields and can be used directly in a Form, or as part of a FormGroup.
 *
 * The simplest Form (`ui5-form`) consists of a header area on top,
 * displaying a header text (see the `headingText` property) and content below - an arbitrary number of FormItems (ui5-form-item),
 * representing the pairs of label and form fields.
 *
 * And, there is also "grouping" available to assist the implementation of richer UIs.
 * This is enabled by the FormGroup (`ui5-form-group`) component.
 * In this case, the Form is structured into FormGroups and each FormGroup consists of FormItems.
 *
 *  ### Responsiveness
 *
 * The Form component reacts and changes its layout on predefined breakpoints.
 * Depending on its size, the Form content (FormGroups and FormItems) gets divided into one or more columns as follows:
 * - **S** (< 600px) – 1 column is recommended (default: 1)
 * - **M** (600px - 1022px) – up to 2 columns are recommended (default: 1)
 * - **L** (1023px - 1439px) - up to 3 columns are recommended (default: 2)
 * - **XL** (> 1439px) – up to 6 columns are recommended (default: 2)
 *
 * To change the layout, use the `layout` property - f.e. layout="S1 M2 L3 XL6".
 *
 * ### Groups
 *
 * To make better use of screen space, there is built-in logic to determine how many columns should a FormGroup occupy.
 *
 * - **Example #1** (perfect match):
 * 4 columns and 4 groups: each group will use 1 column.
 *
 * - **Example #2** (balanced distribution):
 * 4 columns and 2 groups: each group will use 2 columns.
 * 6 columns and 2 groups: each group will use 3 columns.
 *
 * - **Example #3** (unbalanced distribution):
 * 3 columns and 2 groups: the larger one will use 2 columns, the smaller 1 column.
 * 5 columns and 3 groups: two of the groups will use 2 columns each, the smallest 1 column.
 *
 * **Note:** The size of a group element is determined by the number of FormItems assigned to it.
 * In the case of equality, the first in the DOM will use more columns, and the last - fewer columns.
 *
 * - **Example #4** (more groups than columns):
 * 3 columns and 4 groups: each FormGroup uses only 1 column, the last FormGroup will wrap on the second row.
 *
 * ### Groups Column Span
 *
 * To influence the built-in group distribution, described in the previous section,
 * you can use the FormGroup's `columnSpan` property, that defines how many columns the group should expand to.
 *
 * ### Items Column Span
 *
 * FormItem's columnSpan property defines how many columns the form item should expand to inside a form group or the form.
 *
 * ### Items Label Span
 *
 * The placement of the labels depends on the size of the used column.
 * If there is enough space, the labels are next to their associated fields, otherwise  - above the fields.
 * By default, the labels take 4/12 of the FormItem, leaving 8/12 parts to associated fields.
 * You can control what space the labels should take via the `labelSpan` property.
 *
 * **For example:** To always place the labels on top set: `labelSpan="S12 M12 L12 XL12"` property.
