This includes code logic, HTML and CSS.\\n\\n### Enhanced overstyling capabilities for apps\\n    - We can now provide [CSS Shadow Parts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_shadow_parts) also for the \\"popup part\\", not just in the \\"main part\\" of the component!\\n    - [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) set on the component will also have effect for its \\"popup part\\"!\\n\\nConsider the following example:\\n\\n```html\\n<body>\\n    <style>\\n        #mc::part(root) {\\n            background: blue;\\n        }\\n        #mc::part(list) {\\n            margin: 0.5rem;\\n        }\\n    </style>\\n\\n    <my-component id=\\"mc\\">\\n        #shadow-root\\n            <div part=\\"root\\"></div>\\n            <ui5-popover>\\n                <ui5-list part=\\"list\\"></ui5-list>\\n            </ui5-popover>\\n    </my-component>\\n</body>\\n```\\n\\nSince the popover is now part of the component, component authors can provide CSS Shadow Parts for elements in the popover, in addition to the existing CSS Shadow Parts.\\n\\n### Components with popups can now have physical children\\n\\nWeb components with popups had a **hard limitation** of not being able to slot children to the popup.\\n\\nExample of `ui5-select`\'s (simplified) DOM structure in **v1.24**:\\n\\n```html\\n<body>\\n    <ui5-static-area>\\n        <ui5-static-area-item> \x3c!-- static area item of the ui5-select --\x3e\\n            #shadow-root\\n                <ui5-responsive-popover> \x3c!-- the \\"dropdown\\" part of the ui5-select --\x3e\\n                    <ui5-list> \x3c!-- the list inside ui5-select\'s dropdown --\x3e\\n                        <ui5-li text=\\"Option 1\\"></ui5-li> \x3c!-- list item for the 1st ui5-option --\x3e\\n                        <ui5-li text=\\"Option 2\\"></ui5-li> \x3c!-- list item for the 2nd ui5-option --\x3e\\n                        <ui5-li text=\\"Option 3\\"></ui5-li> \x3c!-- list item for the 3rd ui5-option --\x3e\\n                    </ui5-list>\\n                </ui5-responsive-popover>\\n        </ui5-static-area-item>\\n    </ui5-static-area>\\n\\n    .........\\n\\n    <ui5-select>\\n        #shadow-root\\n            <div></div> \x3c!-- The \\"box\\" part of the select --\x3e\\n\\n        <ui5-option>Option 1</ui5-option>\\n        <ui5-option>Option 2</ui5-option>\\n        <ui5-option>Option 3</ui5-option>\\n    </ui5-select>\\n\\n</body>\\n```\\n\\nAs you can clearly see from the example, there is no way to **slot** the `ui5-option` components into the `ui5-list` as it is in a completely different part of the DOM, due to the need for a static area.\\nInstead, we can only provide **logical** `ui5-option` components and just use their **text content** for the `text` property of the list items (`ui5-li`) in the static area.\\n\\nExample of `ui5-select`\'s (simplified) DOM structure in **v2.0**:\\n\\n```html\\n<body>\\n    <ui5-select>\\n        #shadow-root\\n            <div></div> \x3c!-- The \\"box\\" part of the select --\x3e\\n            <ui5-responsive-popover> \x3c!-- the \\"dropdown\\" part of the ui5-select --\x3e\\n                <ui5-list> \x3c!-- the list inside ui5-select\'s dropdown --\x3e\\n                    <slot></slot>\\n                </ui5-list>\\n            </ui5-responsive-popover>\\n\\n        <ui5-option><strong>Option</strong> 1</ui5-option>\\n        <ui5-option><ui5-icon name=\\"accept\\"></ui5-icon> Option 2</ui5-option>\\n        <ui5-option><i>Option 3</i></ui5-option>\\n    </ui5-select>\\n\\n</body>\\n```\\n\\nNow that the popover is part of the `ui5-select` itself, it\'s possible to have **physical** `ui5-option`s and slot their content directly into the popover or its children (`ui5-list` in this example).\\n\\nThis allows us to provide support for **custom user content** for components that had strict predefined APIs in the past!\\n\\n### Easier testing for both apps and component package authors\\n    - Tests no longer need to know how to find the static area item, associated with a given component - everything is directly in the shadow root!\\n    - Writing tests is much simplified.\\n\\n### Cross-framework popup compatibility for the future\\n    - Frameworks who use the native browser popover API no longer need to synchronize themselves (negotiate `z-index` values, etc.).\\n    - The last popup to be opened will always be on top (guarnateed by the browser)!\\n\\n## When can I start using it?\\n    - The current versions of all supported browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge, and now also Firefox as of version 125) fully support the popover API. [See Can I Use report](https://caniuse.com/?search=popover).\\n    - By the time **v2.0** is officially released (we are at **v2.0-r.c.2** as of writing this blog post) we expect that each major browser will have already released at least 3 stable versions since the introduction of the popover API.\\n\\nMake sure to check our blog for future announcements, including the official release date of **UI5 Web Components 2.0**!"},{"id":"/releases/preparing-for-v2","metadata":{"permalink":"/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/blog/releases/preparing-for-v2","source":"@site/blog/releases/preparing-for-v2.mdx","title":"Preparing for UI5 Web Components 2.0","description":"UI5 Web Components 2.0 version is on the horizon.","date":"2024-05-14T11:39:27.000Z","formattedDate":"May 14, 2024","tags":[{"label":"release","permalink":"/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/blog/tags/release"}],"readingTime":2.545,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Preparing for UI5 Web Components 2.0","tags":["release"],"slug":"/releases/preparing-for-v2"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Popover API in UI5 Web Components 2.0","permalink":"/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/blog/releases/popover-api-in-v2"}},"content":"UI5 Web Components 2.0 version is on the horizon.\\nHere\'s a summary of everything you need to know (release information, key features and breaking changes)\\nand start preparing for it.\\n\\n## Release Timelines\\n- Release `2.0` RC versions in April\\n   -
